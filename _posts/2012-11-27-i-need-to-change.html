I need to change .

I need to change whether my attitude towards my college or my thirty-year-old plan. I cann't continue to be impratical.

Now I know I don't have the right to comment our teaching material ,because my inner knowledge is  too superficial . So how can I do that?I need to accept the concept  of  GDUFS ,  and understand it in  the bottom of  my stand-offish heart. I was too  conceited to listen to other voices around me from  Teachers.

I give my sincere apology to you . I cann't   guarantee to follow your steps of teaching ,but I can promise  that I will never comment your teaching method /or the matearial we used .

Next ,about my thirty -year-old plan.  I used to change my own goal , cause I am too scare about my future.I don't know  which job  I really love , I asked myself many times about this question,but ,actually ,my heart cann't give me any answer.

This short experience reminded me of a movie  scripts in <strong><em>“Three idiots”</em></strong>  :    With such fear of  tomorrow ,how'll you live today?

Our hearts are so weak that we should console it --telling it :All is well.

In my memory , Dr. Randy has said : Be good at something ,which will make you valuable.

I remenber that words . I major in Network Engineering .In fact , I am not confident of my teachers ,my college's equipments...ect . I am not faith in I can get good grasping from my school .  But now , I'm a  junior student , I should believe in myself  that I can control it.

Keep going ,don't settle. In order to  supervise and urge myself  to  overcome difficulties ,I write this  weblog !
