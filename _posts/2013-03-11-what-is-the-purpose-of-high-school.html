I absolutely love Paul Graham's take on this in his essay, "Why Nerds are Unpopular"[1]:(I have quoted liberally and added my own emphasis)
<blockquote>Officially the purpose of schools is to teach kids. <b>In fact their primary purpose is to keep kids locked up in one place for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done. . . </b>
</p><p>
I'm suspicious of this theory that thirteen-year-old kids are intrinsically messed up. If it's physiological, it should be universal. Are Mongol nomads all nihilists at thirteen? I've read a lot of history, and I have not seen a single reference to this supposedly universal fact before the twentieth century. Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance seem to have been cheerful and eager. . .
</p><p>
<b>As far as I can tell, the concept of the hormone-crazed teenager is coeval with suburbia.</b> I don't think this is a coincidence. I think teenagers are driven crazy by the life they're made to lead.<b> Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs. Teenagers now are neurotic lapdogs.</b>Their craziness is the craziness of the idle everywhere.</blockquote>
<strong>The original purpose of high school, as researched by <i>John Taylor Gatto[2]</i>, was to prepare adolescents to be plugged into the industrial factory system. For this, it was best that they not be <i>too</i> creative, too fast, or too slow. And thus the outcomeis the stultifying homogenous mediocrity that you see in those who have succumbed. （这跟我之前看到的某篇国内文章讲到的观点相似，现在我也认同这种观点。）</strong>
</p><p>
Thankfully, the human spirit is quite strong, and lots of kids still drop out, finish early, or channel their innate creativity into bizarre and interesting projects during their high-school years.
</p><p>
Now, of course, we need mediocre factory and office drones less than ever, and the institution of high school is due for a replacement by something that looks more like the Renaissance apprentice system referred to by Graham. Kids could be taught to program computers, do graphic design, install solar panels, build 3d printers, run internet businesses, fold proteins, and many other useful and fascinating real-world skills.
</p><p>
Kids are smart and creative. If you put them to work doing things that actually matter, instead of warehousing them in poorly-disguised prisons, the human race would be better for it.
