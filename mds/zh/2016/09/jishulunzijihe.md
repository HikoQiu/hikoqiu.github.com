## Distributed Systems

- [Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/)  - an effort to develop and maintain an open-source server which enables highly reliable distributed coordination.

- [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) - Apache Kafka is publish-subscribe messaging rethought as a distributed commit log.

- [Open-Falcon](http://open-falcon.org/) - 互联网企业级监控系统解决方案。



## Programming

- ### C/C++

- [Libevent](http://libevent.org) - an event notification library.

> The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to signals or regular timeouts.

- [Protocol-buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) - Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. 


## Network Tools

- ### HTTP benchmarking

- [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk)  - a HTTP benchmarking tool
> `wrk` is a modern HTTP benchmarking tool capable of generating significant load when run on a single multi-core CPU. It combines a multithreaded design with scalable event notification systems such as epoll and kqueue.

- [ab](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html) - Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool
> `ab` is a tool for benchmarking your Apache Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server.
