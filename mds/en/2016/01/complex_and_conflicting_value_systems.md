Now I'm sitting at the pumpkin house of Qihoo 360 company's headquarter building's 7th floors, writing this post.

Maybe here're many gramma mistakes or misspellings in every post I wrote, coz I'm new to write in my secondary language which is poor now. If you find any wrongs in my post, please tell me, I would fix it immediately and be very grateful for your advices.

### Which approach/way

I'm not seeking for helps from others about my life questions, actually I enjoy them a lot which bring me troubles continously.

I always think about what the meaning of life is like other young guys do. I can almost list a batch of items which are considered as noble and high ideals. 

For example, do something big:

 - Run a company/org for changing the world (in other words, change/improve users' life quality)
 
 - Do something meaningful to change people's perspectives, like [`TED`](http://ted.com) does. In this regard, I tried to build a website named [`innoGuy`](http://innoGuy.com) to spread different thoughts and make them connected to generate great reactions between users who is eager to accept different points of view and communicate with people who are engaged in the same pursuit.(ps: *innoGuy* has gotten started not long ago, and It's under construction now to gather more thoughtful essays/articles. Non-profit website)
 
 - Become an expert in industry I devote to.
 
 - Join a company with the same vision as I yearm for.
 
 - Help people in bad situations (Yet, I know that I need to be strong enough befor helping others)
 
 - ... etc
 
Every item listed above obviously isn't short term staff, all are long term things which need plenty of ethusiasm, passion, effort...etc. Some of them require capacity of breadth knowledge and ability while other needs depth of industry skills and accumulations. 

Time and energy are limited, so priority is important. Maybe multi-thread dealing is a nice choice, but it means that I may accomplish nothing in the end(just guess).

### Conflicting

Is it conflicting to have two different thoughts like: 

 - Create a company or organization.
 
 - Join a company or organization with the same vision.
